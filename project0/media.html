                        <p>The series picks up seventy years after the end of the Avatar: The Last Airbender story arc with brand new characters and settings.[3] The protagonist of the new series, Korra, the Avatar after Aang, is a hot-headed and rebellious young woman from the Southern Water Tribe who is "ready to take on the world".[8] The series follows Korra as she faces the difficult challenges, duties, and responsibilities that come with being the Avatar. </p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <p>After the conclusion of the Hundred Year War, Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko had brought people from the four nations together and founded the United Republic of Nations, with its capital being Republic City, a large "metropolis powered by steampunk-type technology" such as cars and motorcycles.[9] Aang and Katara had three children, the youngest of which was Tenzin, the only airbender of the three siblings. Meanwhile, Toph Beifong had traveled extensively to teach metalbending to other earthbenders. After Aang's death in 153 AG, he was reincarnated as a Southern Water Tribe girl named Korra.</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <p>At the present time, seventy years after the end of the Hundred Year War, Korra, a rebellious, seventeen-year-old girl, is set to complete her airbending training and fulfill her role as the Avatar.[3][8] She has already mastered waterbending, earthbending, and firebending by this point. At the beginning of the series, Korra travels to Republic City and starts her airbending training with Tenzin.[9][10] Tenzin himself is married to Pema. He has two daughters, Jinora, a "bookworm", and Ikki, a "motor-mouth", while Meelo, his first son, was his only son until the tenth episode, "Turning the Tides", when Pema gave birth to another boy named Rohan.[11]</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <p>However, Republic City is not what Korra imagined it to be. Anti-benders called "Equalists", who oppose the arts of bending, utilize techniques such as chi blocking to further their goals of revolution, led by Amon.[9] Korra must fight rampant crime and the Anti-bending Revolution, assisted by two brothers, Mako, a firebender, and Bolin, an earthbender. She is also joined by her animal companion, Naga, and the Republic City Police Force, who are led by Toph's daughter, Lin Beifong.[11] </p>
